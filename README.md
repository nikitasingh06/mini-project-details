Our mini project is on assembler.We are making an assembler which will convert high level instructions into machine 
instruction and it will  load our objeect program in memory.There are so many hypothetical machines like SIC,SIC/XE etc.We are 
creating a new hypothetical machine which will perform the task of assembler.In order to make our project we are 
following 2 algorithms which are described below:
pass 1
pass 2
pass 1 algorithm is used for creating symbol table,generating addresses,generating opcode.
pass 2 algorithm is used for creating object program.
